	As opposite to most available multiband compressors, this compressor provides numerous special functions listed below:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Modern operating mode</b> - special operating mode that allows to look different at <b>classic</b> crossover-based compressors.
	Crossover-based compressors use crossover filters for splitting the original signal into independent frequency bands, then process
	each band independently by it's individual compressor. Finally, all bands become phase-compensated using all-pass filers and then
	summarized, so the output signal is formed.
	In <b>Modern</b> mode, each band is processed by pair of dynamic shelving filters. This allows the better control the gain of each band.
	</li>
	<li><b>Sidechain boost</b> - special mode for assigning the same weight for higher frequencies opposite to lower frequencies.
	In usual case, the frequency band is processed by compressor 'as is'. By the other side, the usual audio signal has 3 db/octave
	falloff in the frequency domain and could be compared with the pink noise. So the lower frequencies take more
	effect on compressor rather than higher frequencies. <b>Sidechain boost</b> feature allows to compensate the -3 dB/octave falloff
	of the signal spectrum and, even more, make the signal spectrum growing +3 dB/octave in the almost fully audible frequency range.
	This is done by specially designed +3 db/oct and +6 db/oct shelving filters.
	</li>
	<li><b>Lookahead option</b> - each band of compressor can work with some prediction, the lookahead time can be set for each channel independently.
	To avoid phase distortions, all other bands automatically become delayed for a individually calculated period of time. The overall delay time
	of the input signal is reported to the host by the plugin as a latency.
	</li>
	<li><b>Up to 8 bands</b> are available for use, each band is not attached to it's strict frequency range and can control any frequency range. 
	Also, each band can be controlled by completely different frequency range that can be obtained by applying low-pass and hi-pass filters to the
	sidechain signal.
